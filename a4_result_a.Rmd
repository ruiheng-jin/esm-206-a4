## Results A - Visual exploration of changes in annual lobster abundance by site

```{r}
# data structure: each site has several transects, each transect has ABCD replicates

# uncount lobsters so each lobster has its own row
lob_tidy <- lob_abun %>% 
  tidyr::uncount(count)
```

```{r}
# count total lobster count by year and site
lob_yr_site <- lob_tidy %>%
  count(year, site)

# make a line graph of abundance change through the years

## option 1
ggplot(lob_yr_site, aes(x = year, y = n, color = site)) +
  geom_line(size = .5) +
  geom_point()

## option 2
ggplot(lob_yr_site, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  facet_wrap(~site) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
# NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCREASE GAP BETWEEN  
  
  
# geom_col(position = 'dodge') 
```
